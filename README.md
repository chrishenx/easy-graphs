# easy-graphs
A C++ generic library to configure graphs and get their DOT representation easily.

Included features until now!

 - Four graph-related algorithms:
   + DFS
   + BFS
   + Dijkstra
   * Prim

All the above implementations but prim's, have a related method to get a dot representation 
of each iteration of the algorithm, so you can get some sort of animation of its dynamics.
